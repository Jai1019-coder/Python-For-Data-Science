Dear Mr. Deb Chatterjee

As a student representative of my college PSIT Kanpur, I invite your college students to our Technical Symposium. We are organising this event since 2014 and our previous events gave big success to all 
paritcipants. This time we are expecting huge participation with latest technologies, eye catching stall decorations, and mind blowing demos. Topics for this year include Hardware or 
Software implementation to solve social problems. Along with innovative technology exposure we are also inviting few guests to interact with winning participants, this is going to be a great
opportunity as our special guests will invest in technology of winning participants and further guide them for startups. Along with that all participants will get oppurtinity to exchange
great ideas. The winning teams will also get cash prize of about Rs 50000.

Regards
Anushka
