The desire for sensual pleasure is usually the main motivation for humans, and sometimes the wish to have a 
baby or more children. The biological function of vaginal intercourse is human reproduction. During 
coitus without a condom, sperm enter the vagina, first with the pre-ejaculate and then a larger amount 
through male ejaculation.

Sperm swim through the cervix and the uterus into the fallopian tubes of the woman. If they meet a 
fertilisable egg cell after or during an ovulation, or if an ovulation occurs hours or days later, one 
sperm can fertilize it. The resulting zygote develops into the early embryonic stages and, in the meantime, 
migrates from the fallopian tube into the uterus. The nidation of the embryo called blastocyst at this stage 
of development with the beginning of the production of hCG marks the beginning of a pregnancy. Without 
contraceptives, during a woman's fertile days, there is a relatively high probability that conception will 
follow.
